# CentralPark
Use real time availability and walking-distance data to find the best place to park at UCF.

- The app currently does not validate user input, but **it is important to only search for destinations that are included in the autocomplete list.** We plan to validate input in the future, and otherwise the code is ready to test :)

- Code is currently being tested using the Nexus 5 emulator with API 22 in Android Studio 3.3.1.
